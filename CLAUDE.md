# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a production-ready MCP (Model Context Protocol) server running in a Kali Linux Docker container. It provides AI assistants with access to a comprehensive security toolset for penetration testing and security analysis. The server communicates via Server-Sent Events (SSE) and allows AI to execute commands in a controlled environment.

## Commands

### Building and Running

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t kali-mcp-server .

# Run with default settings (SSE mode on port 8000)
docker run -p 8000:8000 kali-mcp-server

# Run the tests
./run_tests.sh

# Quick build and run
./run_docker.sh
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Type checking
pyright

# Linting
ruff check .

# Formatting
ruff format .

# Running tests
pytest
```

### Package Management

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add a new dependency
pip install <package-name>
```

## Architecture

The project is structured as a Python MCP server with three main components:

1. `kali_mcp_server/server.py` - Core server implementation that handles MCP protocol
2. `kali_mcp_server/tools.py` - Implementation of the tools offered by the server
3. Main entry points: `main.py` and `kali_mcp_server/__main__.py`

The server provides three main tools through the MCP protocol:

1. `run` - Execute shell commands in the Kali Linux environment
2. `fetch` - Fetch web content from specified URLs
3. `resources` - List available system resources and command examples

Commands are validated against an allowlist for security, and long-running commands are executed in the background.

The Docker container is based on Kali Linux and includes a wide range of pre-installed security tools:
- Network scanning (nmap)
- Penetration testing (metasploit)
- Password brute-forcing (hydra)
- Directory enumeration (gobuster, dirb)
- Web vulnerability scanning (nikto)
- SQL injection testing (sqlmap)

The container is configured to run as a non-root user for improved security.

## Integration with Claude Desktop

The MCP server is designed to be used with Claude Desktop by adding a configuration entry to:
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kali-mcp-server": {
      "transport": "sse",
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/sse",
      "command": "docker run -p 8000:8000 kali-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

See CLAUDE_INTEGRATION.md for detailed integration instructions.

## Security Note

This container provides access to powerful security tools. It includes several security measures:

1. Commands are validated against an allowlist
2. The server runs as a non-root user inside the container
3. Long-running commands are executed with appropriate controls
4. Input validation is applied to commands and URLs

It should only be used responsibly and in controlled environments.
